	<p> Now this is the story all about how<br>
My life got flipped, turned upside down<br>
And I'd like to take a minute just sit right there<br>
I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel Air<br>
In west Philadelphia born and raised<br>
On the playground where I spent most of my days<br>
Chilling out, maxing, relaxing all cool<br>
And all shooting some b-ball outside of the school<br>
When a couple of guys who were up to no good<br>
Started making trouble in my neighborhood<br>
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared<br>
And said you're moving with your auntie and uncle in Bel Air<br>
